Introduction
FredCit is a room type Bulletin Board (BBS) system.
Originally derived from a game in the University of
Washington mainframe system, the software has progressed
over the years to become one of the best Citadel BBS systems
available.

This software is the work of many hands, I'd like to take a
moment to give credit to those I know of that have worked on
it.  Unfortunately, most of the BBS authors who work on
Citadels use pseudonyms (nyms in Citadel terminology), thus
I can only mention the names I know.  Gremlin produced the
first MS-DOS version of Citadel (which ran only on CP/M
system prior to that),  Dragon, Ray Johnson, Z'ton and Joe
Broxson created the version called DragCit.  Ray Johnson
went on to create TurboCit.  TurboCit is commercial BBS
software (an ad for which is included in this package).
FredCit is derived from the only public release of TurboCit
source code.  Zen Master and I did the early work on
FredCit, and today I (Fred) do the majority of the work,
with occasional routines donated by Zen Master, Jeremiah
Johnson, and others.

Thanks to all, (including those I've neglected to mention,
or don't know about), for your contributions.  I'd also like
to thank other authors for their public domain source code
releases, which have helped improve FredCit. These include:
Marty Del Vecchio for his swap code, (SWAP.ASM), Wayne
Conrad for the serial drivers (IBMCOM.PAS),and RAC for the
conversion of these drivers to C.

Installation

Installation can take some time.  Be patient, the results
are well worth it.

Basics

First of all, create a "HOMEPATH" directory on your drive.
This directory is usually called C:\FCIT, remember the name
of this directory, you will need it later.  Then install the
files from the release zip files into the appropriate
directories on your hard drive (floppy disk users will want
to use FFCIT.EXE instead of FCIT.EXE).  Use the -d option to
PKUNZIP for this, so that the directories contained in the
.ZIP files will be created.

Example:

     c:
     md \fcit
     cd \fcit
     pkunzip -d a:\fcit41.zip c:\fcit
     pkunzip -d a:\fcitfile.zip c:\fcit

Use the appropriate names for FCIT41.ZIP (changes with each
release), and FCITFILE.ZIP.  CompuServe users will note that
the .ZIP file names have been shortened to 6 characters.

PKUNZIP will create other paths that citadel will look for.
These are referred to as "TEMPPATH", "APPLICATION",
"MSGPATH", and "ROOMPATH".

The default paths are:

c:\fcit             HOMEPATH and MSGPATH
c:\fcit\HELP   HELPPATH
c:\fcit\ROOMS     ROOMPATH
c:\fcit\TEMP   TEMPPATH
c:\fcit\APLIC  APPLICATIONS

You make change these paths by editing the directory
settings CONFIG.CIT, creating the new directories, and
moving the files to the new path(s). If you do, make sure no
path is a root directory. If you want to use a ram disk, for
your TEMPPATH you need to make a directory on that disk to
use.  If you do customize the directories FCit uses, it is
very important that you do not use the same path for both
HOMEPATH and TEMPPATH.

Your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files

Before you attempt to run FredCit, look at your CONFIG.SYS
file on your boot drive.  The FILES setting should be at
least 20.  If there is no FILES line in your CONFIG.SYS, add
the following line to it with an ASCII text editor:

     FILES=20

There are a couple of options that may be set in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  These are called "87" and "TZ".

TZ sets your time zone name (three characters, and theoffset
from Greenwich mean time).  87 allows you to tellFredCit if
an 80x87 coprocessor exists in your system.  If youdo not
set a value here, the BBS system will test for thepresence
of a coprocessor at start up.  If you have a BBS in the
Pacific time zone, and no 80x87 coprocessor, you would use
these lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

     SET 87=N
     SET TZ=PST8PDT

Substitute your time zone's abbreviation where PST and PDT
are used.
Your .CIT Files

Citadel uses a very flexible (and sometimes confusing)
configuration method.  Most editable parameters are kept in
files with the extension .CIT.  Except for FILEINFO.CIT, all
.CIT files are editable text files.  Each of these files
contains information on what the parameters do.

CONFIG.CIT          System Configuration

CRON.CIT       Time based events

EXTERNAL.CIT   External programs & protocols

GRPDATA.CIT         Accounting data

NODES.CIT      Networking data

ROUTE.CIT      Networked mail paths

All .CIT file parameters start with a '#' character as the
very first character on the line.  Anything else (including
beginning the line with a space), will disable the
parameter.  Parameters consisting of more then one word
should be quoted, and more then one value may be specified
ona single line where noted.  C language style escape
charactersin quoted strings are supported.  Be careful with
this, tospecify a path in a quoted string, you will need to
double upthe '\' characters.  Thus, C:\FCIT\APLIC becomes
"C:\\FCIT\\APLIC" when quoted.  Some control characters can
be inserted in parameters by using '^' as a prefix.  Ctrl+G
would become ^G in a quoted string.

You will eventually need to edit all of the .CIT files
except the FILEINFO.CIT files.  The setup (.CIT) files all
contain comments describing the parameters in them.  Start
out with CONFIG.CIT.  Most of the defaults for these
parameters should be usable.  Pay careful attention to the
path parameters, as no special error checking is done on
these.  The paths must exist!  I recommend you use a drive
letter when specifying any path.  If you do not intend to
network your board, you can ignore ROUTE.CIT and NODES.CIT.

FCit Command Line Options

Several options are available when you start FredCit from
the DOS command line.  The general format is:

     FCIT [options]

Options can be specified in any order.  Options can be in
upper or lower case, and may be prefixed with '-' or '/'.
The'-?' command line option displays all of the valid
commandline options and arguments.

Valid DOS command line options (switches) are:

     -b baud        Starting baud rate (300-19200).  This is
needed when running in shell/door mode from another BBS.

     -c        Read configuration files and rebuild .DAT
files.

     -d        DesqView/TopView (not working yet).

     -e        Use EMS memory for overlays (faster!).

     -l pass        Log in with the "initials;password"
(pass) ifthe accout exists.

     -p num         Set output pacing to num milliseconds
betweencharacters.  Intended for PC emulation systems runing
on non-IBM compatable computers.

     -s        Run as a shell from another BBS.  This
suppresses hang-up and modem initialization.

     -u name        Log in the named user, if the account
exists.

     -v        Just run cron events and exit back to DOS.

     -x        Use extended memory for overlays.  Due to
hardware problems with the 80286microprocessor, this option
only works on80386 or 80486 systems.

     -?        Displays command line options.


Networking

Portions of this section derived from Z'ton's NETWORK.DOC.

Compatible Citadels can exchange messages in one or more
rooms via networking.  There are several steps to setting up
anetwork link between two boards:

     Set up the node accounts on each board

     Edit your network setup in NODES.CIT

     Add a time based (CRON) NETWORK event in CRON.CIT

     Test the network link

Before you network, you need to find a node to network with.
It's helpful to net with someone who has had experience
setting up netting.  Look at the GRID.HLP file for numbers
ofpublic BBS's if you don't currently know anyone helpful on
thenet.  Most of these boards carry rooms where you can get
yourquestions answered, and find other Citadels to network
with. Most of these boards will net with you, so don't be
shy! Currently, our network is active in Seattle, Dallas,
Washington DC, and the bay area (CA).  We are looking for
newareas to network to.

Networking requires a Hayes compatible modem (or near
compatible) that will hang up when the DTR line is lowered.
(See your modem technical reference manual for appropriate
settings on your modem).  This section assumes you have
already made the file transfer protocol work.  See the notes
in the top if EXTERNAL.CIT for more information on how to do
this.

Setting up a node account

To net two boards each board needs an account on the other.
Log in on your system as a new user with the initials and
password the other board will use.  Remember these, you will
need them later.  The new name should exactly match the
otherboards name.  Terminate.  Log-in as a sysop and .SU
(SysopUserlog) the new account, making that it is a NODE
account. Also give them the groups needed to get into any
room theywant to network (.SGU).

This must be done on both boards for the net to function.

Node File Entries

Edit the file NODES.CIT with any editor that will save to a
normal text file.  In this file contains information on all
the nodes that your board nets with.  Look in NODES.CIT for
more information on this.

Nodes entry file format:

#NODE         "Node Name" "Region Name"
#PHONE        "555-5555"
#BAUD         2400
#DIAL_TIMEOUT 30
#REDIAL       3
#LOGIN        W "als:" S "initials;password"
#WAIT_TIMEOUT 15
#PROTOCOL     "Zmodem"
#MAIL_TMP     "Nodename.mai"
#EXPIRE       25
#GROUP        "Your Group" "Their Group"
#ROOM         "Your Room"  "Their Room"

  #NODE
The name and region of the node you want to net with.  All
names are quoted strings of 30 characters or less each.  The
region is not used in message transfer.  Make sure the node
name exactly matches the name in your BBS's user log.  Also
make sure the node and region names match those of the
remote system.

  #PHONE
The phone number for your modem to dial in order to reach
the other BBS.  Must be a quoted string of thirty characters
or less.  First dial this number manually, and make darn
sure it's a modem on the other end.  If you have any
problems, check again.  We don't want to harass the
electronic nonentities out there (read: people without
modems).

  #BAUD
The baud rate to connect to the other system at. This must
be in the range of 300 to 19200.

  #DIAL_TIMEOUT
The number of seconds before giving up on connecting to the
other board.  Use a number here, usually 30-45 seconds,
longer in some areas.

  #REDIAL
The number of times to attempt the dial out before quitting.

  #LOGIN
A script to log you into the remote board.  Use the initials
and password you created your board's account on the remote
system with.  Allowed commands in this script are:

     P seconds Pause, dumping modem input

     S "text"  Send text

     W "text"  Wait for text

     ! "program"    Run a program

  #WAIT_TIMEOUT
The number of seconds to wait for the log-in script W
command text to come in.  This normally translates into the
amount of time it takes a log-in to fail (sometimes called
"Zombie Modem").

  #PROTOCOL
The name of the protocol to use from EXTERNAL.CIT.

  #MAIL_TMP
A path for all mail being routed to this board.  I'm
planning a future enhancement to automatically place all of
this in a sub directory.  Please use a simple file name here
for now.

  #EXPIRE
Oldest message in days.  This is the age of oldest message
that will be accepted over the network.  Older messages will
be 'expired', and do not appear in your message base.  To
avoid duplicates, do not use a number larger the your
message base's oldest possible message.  If you haven't been
running your BBS long enough to "scroll" your message base,
use are reasonable number, such as 30.  If you have already
filled your message base at least once, you can check to see
how often the message base scrolls.  To check for this, log
in as a sysop, and do the command ".R#".  Accept the default
value for the message number to read.  This will be the
oldest message currently on your system.  Calculate the
number of days old this message is, and use that value here.

  #GROUP
You may have any number of #GROUP lines, up the total number
of groups your system may contain (64).  The first name is
the name of the group on your system.  The second name is
the group name on the system you net with.  These usually
are the same, but you can use these to convert a group name.
The #GROUP lines affect networked, group only messages.
These messages will only be visible to members of the group.
You may enter a networked, group only message by using the
.EG or .EL commands in a networked room.  The names used
here are quoted strings of 30 characters or less.

  #ROOM
As with #GROUP, you can have as many #ROOM lines as you
want, up to the number of rooms in your system (maximum
255). These lines determine which rooms exchange messages.
The first room name is the networked room on your system,
the second is the networked room on the remote system.  It
is wise to use the same name in both places when the room is
widely netted.   This prevents "cross netted" rooms, where
the contents of one room inadvertently end up in another
room.

On many boards a privately netted room is created for each
node netted to.  You might want to try this.  On each board,
create a networked room, (using the .ER and .AE commands),
named after the other board.  Then each board adds a #ROOM
line like:

     #ROOM     "Their BBS name"    "Your BBS name"

This will map the messages from their board into a room on
your BBS named after their board, and your messages into a
room on their BBS named after yours.

Make sure that the other board's account has access to all
of the rooms netted.  If any of the networked rooms are
group only type rooms, you will need to check the other
board's group access vs. the groups of the rooms involved.
If any of the rooms are hidden, log in under the node's
account, and do a .goto to the room before netting.

The other sysop MUST create a matching room list, or else
the messages will not net both ways.  A telephone
conversation while editing these files helps greatly.
Notice that the room lists on the two systems will be the
same, with the room name columns reversed.  A text editor
with the ability to move columns of text is useful here.

The Route File

Edit the file ROUTE.CIT.  Examples of the formats allowed:

#ROUTE          "Fred's Toy"    "The Fifth Dimension"
#ALIAS          "TOY"           "Fred's Toy"
#DEFAULT_ROUTE  "The Fifth Dimension"

  #ROUTE
You may have any number of #ROUTE lines.  These lines define
where mail for systems you do NOT net with goes.  Make sure
you do not have a #ROUTE line for any systems you directly
network with.  The first name is the board the mail is
destined for.  The second name is the board that the mail
will actually be sent to, in route to the destination board.
It is best to use the name of a board directly netted to the
destination board in the second position, wherever possible.
The second name must be a board you directly network with,
and must exactly match the spelling of the boards account
name in your user log.

  #ALIAS
BBS aliases (often known as 'zips'), are used when entering
network mail with the .EE command.  For example, if you were
sending mail to "Fred @ Fred's Toy", you might enter "Fred @
Toy" instead.  To do this, you would need a #ALIAS line like
the example above.

  #DEFAULT_ROUTE
If set, the default route is where mail is sent, when you
don't directly net with the destination board, and no #ROUTE
line exists for the destination BBS.  The default route BBS
name should be a board that your system directly networks
with.  Be sure the spelling exactly matches the boards log-
in name.

Testing the Network Link
After completing the above sections, and editing the
CRON.CIT file (see the Time Based Events chapter), you are
ready to test the network link.

First of all, check the telephone number you entered in
NODES.CIT.  Make sure you are not calling someone's voice
line by mistake, and the there is a modem on the other end
giving you that nasty carrier squeal.

Do a .SCL (Sysop Cron List) to view the cron table.  Make
sure the NETWORK entry for the board you're netting with is
in there.  If it isn't, do a .SCE (Sysop Cron Enter) to load
the cron file.

Log out, if you're logged in.

Press ALT-E.  This will start off the next cron event.  Any
key press after this will abort a network attempt.  If
necessary, you can use .SCL to see what's going on.  The
command .SCR (Sysop Cron Reset) can be used to cause a
'done' event to be ready to run again.

Watch the screen!

First, your system will attempt to dial the remote system.
If you have problems getting past this step, use ALT-D to
turn on debug mode.  The system will then display the modem
response codes.  Common problems here are:

  Wrong #MDATA port number in CONFIG.CIT (the board would
  never answer if you have this problem.

  Incorrect phone number.  Remember that long distance
  calls require a 1 and sometimes an area code.  Some PBX's
  require a 9 be dialed to first get an outside line.  Use
  commas for delays if needed here.

  A mismatch between the modem response codes set up in
  DUMB_MODEM in CONFIG.CIT and the modem switch settings.

After the dial out, and log-in to the remote board, the
system will attempt to run your communications protocol
several times.  Common problems here are:

  DSZ.COM not in your APLIC path.

  Different protocols on the two boards.

  HOMEPATH and TEMPPATH are the same.

  Out of disk space on the TEMPPATH.

  Out of memory (use .RS to check free memory).  More
  memory can be freed by using the '!' prefix in your
  protocol settings.

After the link completes, you will see a summary display of
the messages transferred.  Errors listed here will also be
entered as message in your Aide room.


Time Based Events
A time based (CRON) event is a command that Citadel will run
every so often using the commands in the CRON.CIT file.
This file controls automatic networking, and any time based
programs you may want to play with (usually a batch file).

Citadel checks about every 3 minutes to see if anything is
going on.  If anything has happened in the last 3 minutes,
Citadel continues to wait.  But if nothing has happened in 3
minutes it checks it's CRON.CIT file.  If there is an event
to run, Citadel will run the event.  If not, it resets the
modem and nothing else happens.

Editing the CRON events
  Cron file format:
#DO          NETWORK    "Node Name"
#HOURS       ANY
#DAYS        ANY
#REDO_TIME   480
#RETRY_TIME  0

  #DO
Several types of cron events can be specified in the #DO
command.  The format for the #DO line must be one of these
four formats:

     #DO SHELL_1 "program"

     #DO NETWORK "Node Name"

     #DO LOCAL   "Node Name"

     #DO EXIT    0

SHELL_1 events are used for running external programs. These
events are cleared whenever the program event runs.  The
format for the program line is flexible, and defined in
CRON.CIT.

NETWORK events are used for firing off a network linkup
between two boards.  This type of event is cleared when the
network link completes.

  #HOURS
This defines the hours during which the event can happen.
Valid hours are 0-23, or Any.  You can have more then one
hour on a single #HOUR line.  To have a program run
somewhere between 1 AM and 3 AM when there is time, use a
#HOURS line like:

     #HOURS 1 2 3

To allow the event to happen at any hour, use:

     #HOURS Any

  #DAY
This defines the days the event can happen on.  Valid days
are Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, or Any.  You can have
more then one day on a single #DAY line.  To have an event
only run on weekends, use a #DAY line like:

     #DAY Sat Sun

To allow the event to happen on any day, use:

     #DAY Any

  #REDO_TIME
This is the minimum number of minutes the BBS will wait
before it will attempt the event again after successfully
completing it.
This is the minimum number of minutes the BBS will wait
before attempting a network event again after it fails.
