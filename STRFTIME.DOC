        This file and the program STRF.EXE are provided to help you
    configure your time date stamp for FredCit. The program works
    exactly as FredCit does. It takes the format string as a command
    line argument (use quotes if it has spaces). Has a 80 char limit on
    the output just as FredCit does. A simple example follows.

    STRF "%B %d %Y, %I:%M:%S %p %Z"

    output for 12/30/88 10:05:00 PST would be:

    December 30 1988, 10:05:00 AM PST

    One note, you can reset the time zone by putting this command line in
    your autoexec.bat file.

    set TZ=XXX#XXX
            ^ ^ ^
            | | \ optional second time zone name.
             \ \  number of hours difference from GMT. 8 for PST.
              \   Time zone name.

    set TZ=EST5EDT

    This would be a setting for Eastern standard time zone.
