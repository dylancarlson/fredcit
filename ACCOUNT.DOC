                                 INTRODUCTION 
      
      
          Welcome  to the world of simplified Citadel Accounting. Because
     so  many people  felt the  old accounting  system of  Citadel was to
     difficult to setup/use/understand, a new system has been developed. 
      
          This  new system is easier to understand in that you don't have
     to deal with costs per kilobyte, etc. This system works on the basis
     of  time per  day. This  makes setup much  easier for  the sysop and
     understanding  of how much time he has  left on the system easier to
     understand for the user.  
      
          While  you gain this simplicity in use, you also keep the power
     that  was  available in  the old  accounting  system. You  can limit
     different  groups to different  days and hours of  the day for usage
     and  you can also give different  groups times when their accounting
     is  disabled. For example people in  your "Advanced Users" group can
     call with unlimited time from 12am to 9am, while people in your NULL
     group only have unlimited time from 12am to 7am. 
      
      
                                   PRIORITY 
      
      
          A  new feature not  found in the  previous accounting is "group
     priority". This feature has many uses. It will allow you to, in your
     GRPDATA.CIT  file,  give certain  groups  priority over  others. For
     example,  you  would give  your NULL  group a  priority of  1 (least
     important) and you would give your "access" group a higher priority,
     and  your "advanced users" group and even higher priority. If a user
     was  in all 3  groups, Cit would  only look at  the "advanced users"
     group because it has the highest priority. Another good use for this
     is  if you have a group for twits  or users who you want to limit to
     less time than the other users while still having access to the same
     groups  they have, you  could set this group  with priority over all
     the  other access groups and the user  would be limited to what that
     group would allow. 
      
          If  two  or more  groups  have the  same  priority, and  a user
     belongs to two or more of them, Cit will look at the groups and make
     a  compromise, giving them the best deal that is can from combining
     the best of all the groups with the highest priority. 
      
          If  you do not make  an entry in GRPDATA.CIT  for a group, it's
     priority  will default  to zero.  It is  necessary that  you make an
     entry for your NULL group. 
      
                          MULTIPLIERS AND TRANSFERS 
      
      
          With  this system  of accounting  you can  allow users "special
     rates"  for transfers. For example, you can  allow a user to only be




                                   Page - 1







     charged  for 1/2 the  time an upload  took or you  could give them a
     bonus of EXTRA time on the board as a "thank-you" for uploading. 
     This is all done through the #DL_MULT and #UL_MULT key words.  
      
     Examples of values and results are: 
      
          VALUE     RESULT
            -2      Charge them for 2* what the transfer took 
            -1      Charge them for how long the transfer took 
           -.5      Charge them for 1/2 what the transfer took 
             0      Charge/credit nothing (ignore the transfer) 
            .5      Give them 1/2 the time the transfer took EXTRA 
                    Here you must remember that during a transfer, 
                    time "stands still", but after the transfer, the 
                    time took is multiplied by the multiplier 
                    and the result is added to the time in their 
                    account before the transfer... so... 
                    ACC_BAL = (ACC_BAL + (TRNS_TIME * MULT) ); 
                    is the formula cit uses to calculate your 
                    balance after a transfer. 
                     
                                        
                                        
                                SETTING IT UP
      
      
          In your CONFIG.CIT you will find some key words you must set. To
     activate accounting set #ACCOUNTING to 1.  
      
          You  must give unlogged  users some time on  the system, so you
     can set that with #UNLOGGEDBALANCE followed by the number of minutes
     you wish to allow. 
      
          You  also must give new users a time limit on their first call.
     This  is set with #NEWBAL followed by the number of minutes you wish
     to allow them.  
      
          Last, in CONFIG.CIT you must set an overall maximum for time on
     system.  This is set  with #MAXBALANCE followed  by the most time you
     want  any group to  allow. (It is  suggested that this  is set to an
     outrageous time. The only time it will be used is if a users priority
     group  does not have an entry. Meaning they are not in any groups in
     GRPDATA.CIT.)  But,  remember, it  must be  higher  than any  of the
     #MAX_BAL key words in GRPDATA.CIT. 
      
          In  the GRPDATA.CIT file, you need to set each of the following
     for all groups you desire accounting to look at. 
      
          #GROUP         <group name IN QUOTES> 
      
          #DAYS          <days on which this group can call> 
               SUN MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT and ANY are all valid here. 
      
          #HOURS         <hours in which this group can call> 



                                   Page - 2






               0-23 valid, or ANY for any time. 
      
          #SPECIAL       <hours in which this group is unlimited> 
               0-23 valid, or ANY for always. 
      
          #DAY_INC       <how many minutes users will be given  
                          every 24 hours.>
      
          #MAX_BAL       <the MAXIMUM minutes this group can have online
                          per day.>
      
          #PRIORITY      <see section on priorities.)
               any number from 0-10^23 (10 to the 23rd power). 
      
          #UL_MULT       multiplier for uploads
                         (see section on multipliers)
          #DL_MULT       multiplier for downloads
                         (see section on multipliers)
      
      
          Following is a sample enter in your GRPDATA.CIT file:
      
          #GROUP    "null"
          #DAYS     mon tue wed thu fri sat sun
          #HOURS    any
          #SPECIAL  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
          #DAY_INC  60
          #MAX_BAL  120
          #PRIORITY 1
          #UL_MULT  0
          #DL_MULT -1
      
          This  entry will allow  members of group "null"  to call on any
     day at any time and from midnight till 7:59 they have unlimited call
     time.  After  24  hours have  past  since  their first  call  of the
     previous  day call,  they will receive  60 minutes,  and the maximum
     their  balance can  reach is  120 minutes.  (If they  don't call for
     several days their time will compound to a maximum of 120.) 
      
          If the user uploaded a file taking 5 minutes, at the end of the
     transfer,  they would still have the  same time left they did before
     the  transfer. If the user downloaded  a file taking 5 minutes, they
     would have 5 minutes less in their account after the transfer. 
      
          If  a user  does a  download that  takes more  than their daily
     limit,  it will allow it, but, they  will be given negative time and
     will  have to wait for time to compound to a number of minutes above
     zero before they can login again.
