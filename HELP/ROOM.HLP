 2HELP ROOM0

 2--- General ---0

 Rooms are lists of messages, with a 20-character name.  A room may appear
in one or more hallways.
 Sometimes you won't be able to go to all of the rooms.  This may be because
some are in another hallway, or some of them are group-only, or some of
them may be hidden.  See about hidden and group-only rooms below.

 2--- Moving around ---0

 G        -- To go to the next room with unread messages.
 B        -- Skip to the next room w/o changing the curent rooms
             message pointers.
 +        -- To go to the next room.
 -        -- To go to the previous room.
 .Groom   -- To go to a specific room.
 .Broom   -- Skip to a specific room w/o changing the curent rooms
             message pointers.
 J        -- Jump back to the last room you were in.

 "G" will go to the next room with unread messages.  "+" and "-" travel
through each room in sequence.  To go to a specific room, use the .Groom
command.  You can enter a partial roomname for this command.  Jumpback
backs up to the last room you were in.  It restores message the pointers, in
the room you left, and the room you jump back to.

 Goto roomname accepts partial roomname matches.  To avoid ambiguities, it
searches forward from the current room.

 2--- Listing Rooms ---0

 K        -- Known rooms.
 .KD      -- Known Directory rooms.
 .KN      -- Known Newrooms only.
 .KM      -- Known Mail rooms.
 .KW      -- Known Windows.
 .KS      -- Known Shared rooms.

 The Known command lists all of the rooms in the current hallway which you
can access.  The Known Newrooms commands lists only those rooms with unread
messages.  The Known Windows command lists only those rooms which exit
to other hallways, which is useful if you must escape a hallway.  Known
Shared rooms shows all rooms that are networked.

 2--- Creating Rooms ---0

 .ER      -- Enter Room.
 .ELR     -- Enter Limited-Access Room.

 These two commands create rooms.  The Enter Room command creates a room that
can possibly be accesses by anyone.  The Enter Limited-Access Room command
may create a room that is limited to the members of a particular group.
You may only create a group-only room for groups that you are a member of.
 You may also create hidden rooms with either of these commands.  Hidden rooms
will not be listed in your Known rooms list until you have visited.  Once
you have visited them, they act just like regular rooms.  But you cannot
do this until you have explicitly use the ".G" command to goto the room,
entering its complete roomname.
