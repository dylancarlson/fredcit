 2HELP HALLWAY0

 2--- General ---0

 Hallways are sets of rooms.  They are analogous to Floors on Minibin-type
systems, but with important differences:
 (1)  A room may appear in more than one hallway.
 (2)  You may change hallways only from certain rooms, these rooms are called
windows.
 Only the sysop can create hallways, and aide-privilege people can add
or remove rooms from them.

 2--- Listing halls ---0

 .RH  -- Read Hallways.

 Read Hallways lists hallways accessible from the room you are in.

 .KW  -- Known Windows

 This tells you what rooms in the curent hall go to other places. The
verbose flag (.KVW) will tell you where they go.

 2--- Changing halls ---0

 >    -- Next Hall.
 <    -- Previous Hall.

 The Next and Previous Hallway commands are a quick and easy way to switch
between hallways.  They will only reach hallways accessible from the
current room.

 .EH  -- Enter Hallway.

 Enter Hallway lets you select a hallway by name.  The hallway must
be one that is accessible from the current room.
