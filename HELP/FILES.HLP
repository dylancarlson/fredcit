 2--- General ---0

 Download functions are available in special rooms called directory rooms.
Directory rooms have a "]" after the roomname, rather than the normal ">"
character.  The following commands are used to list files, to download them,
or to upload files:


 2--- Listing files ---0

 .RD  -- Read Directory
 .RVD -- Read Verbose Directory
 .RI  -- Read Infofile
 .RVI -- Read Verbose Infofile
 .RA  -- Read Archive
 .RVA -- Read Archive

 The Read Directory commands list the available files in the current room.
This commands waits for an optional filename (possibly wildcarded, per
UNIX filename conventions) and will restrict its output to those
files selected.  The default is to list all of the files.
 The Verbose option gives an extended listing with date, filesize in bytes and
download time.
 The info files are the same, but they include a comment on the file if
one was entered during the upload.
 The read archive command allows you to view the contents of a archive,
normaly extended '.arc'.

 2--- Downloading files ---0
 (Reciving files from FredCit)

 .RT  -- Read Textfile
 .RW  -- Read WC-Protocol
 D    -- Download

 These commands download files.  Read Textfile will request a filename,
file will be printed (as is) to you.  Read WC-Protocol will download a file
using XMODEM protocol, and the Download command will let you choose a
protocol.
 Note that with batch protocols you can specify multiple file names to
download. You can also use UNIX wild cards (see the wild cards section below).

 2--- Uploading files ---0
 (Sending files to FredCit)

 .ET  -- Enter Textfile
 .EW  -- Enter WC-Protocol
 U    -- Upload

 These commands are the inverse of the above two download commands.  They
actually create files on the local system.  After supplying the filename, you
will be asked to supply a brief comment describing the file.  You have about
60 characters.
 Using the Limited-access flag will make it a hidden file.
 Batch protocols will not prompt you for a file name, but will ask for
comments after the transfer for each of the files.
 (Note:  You terminate a file in Enter Textfile with control-Z).

 2--- Wildcards ---0

 FredCit supports UNIX style wild cards for file names.  These wildcards
work like this:

 * replaces any amount of charachters
 ? replaces any one charachtres
 [a-z] replaces a range of chrachters.

 Leagal uses are:

 *.c        [a-l]form.txt       version?.arc
