 Commands work two ways:  single-key and multiple-key.  To enter a single-key
command, simply press that key.  To enter multiple-key commands, press the '.'
key, the key for that command, and any parameters.

 Most single-key commands are default forms of multiple-key commands.  For
example, typing "3G0" will goto the next room with new messages, while
"3.GZOOT0" will go to the room ZOOT.  Typical commands commonly used
include:

 "3L0" -- Will login to the system.  This way you can keep track of new
messages and private mail.

 "3N0" -- Will read new messages in a room.

 "3E0" -- Will let you enter a message.

 "3G0" -- Will go to the next room with unread messages.

 "3T0" -- Will log you off and hangup.

 "3.EE0" -- Will let you enter a private message.

 "3.ER0" -- Will let you create a new room.

 "3.EC0" -- Will let you change your terminal configuration.

 "3.TS0" -- Will log you off without hanging up, someone with you can
login without having to call back.

 To get a list of options for each command, you can
use the following conventions:

 "3.E?0" -- Lists options for the Enter command.
 "3.H?0" -- Lists options for the Help command.
 "3.K?0" -- Lists options for the Known command.
 "3.R?0" -- Lists options for the Read command.
 "3.T?0" -- Lists options for the Terminate command.
