 2HELP AIDE0

 The Citadel system contains a large collection of features, many of
which are quite complex.  The following describes how aide commands act
upon messages, rooms, groups, and hallways.  In addition a few miscellaneous
commands are described.

 2--- Messages ---0

 Marking:
 Messages can be marked by typing "3m0" while the message is printed out.
The message will be printed again, and you will be asked to confirm your
choice.

 Problem users:
 Messages from problem users are only visible to aides.  Such messages
have the message "[problem user]" prominently in the header. Aides will be
prompted "Release? (Y/N)[N]:" after each Problem user message.  If a message
is released, all users will be able to see it.  A released message will
display "[viewable problem user]" in the header, and can be unreleased by
marking the message.

 Moderation:
 Messages posted in moderated rooms will not be viewable to regular users
until someone with Aide access releases them.  The message will display
"[moderated]" in the header, and the aide will be prompted "Release (Y/N)[N]:"
after the message header.  When a message is released, all users can see it.
A released message can be unreleased by marking it.

 Networked messages:
 Messages received from the network can be manipulated as can any other
message.  Any message posted in a networked room bu any user with Network
access will be sent over the network.  If a user without network status posts
in a networked room, the message will be tagged and FredCit will pause and
ask "Release? (Y/N)[Y]:".  If the message is released, it will be sent out
on the network, if not it will only be visible on the local system.

 Deleting:
 To kill messages, type "3k0" while the message is printing out,
the message will be printed again, and you will be asked to confirm your
choice.  Deleted messages are noted in the Aide room, so they can be
retrieved if they need to be put back.

 "3.AI0"  -- Aide Insert-Message.

 This command inserts the most recently marked or deleted message in the
current room.  The message is the same message as the old one.  It has the
name of the room it came from added to the header.

 2--- Rooms ---0

 Rooms can be created by any user (subject to sysop policy).  The sysop
can optionally choose to restrict room creation only to Aides.

 "3.AE0"  -- Aide Edit-Room

 This command can modify the attributes of a room, the things that
can be modified include:  [Braces indicate command used at the edit
prompt]

 (1)  The name of the room                             [3C0hange name]
 (2)  The group that owns the room (if any)            [3G0roup only]
 (3)  Whether the room is permanent or not             [3P0ermanent]
 (4)  Whether the room is public or hidden             [3H0idden]
 (5)  Whether the room is read-only or not             [3R0ead only]
 (6)  Change room Info-line.                           [3I0nfo-line]
 (6)  Whether the room is moderated.                   [3M0oderated]
 (7)  Make changes permanent and exit.                 [3S0ave Changes]
 (7) *Whether or not the room is Networked/Shared.     [3N0etworked]
 (8) *Set room description file.                       [3F0ilename]
 (9) *Create directory room/edit directory path        [3D0irectory]
 (10)*Set up applications                              [3A0pplication]

 * indicates that that function can only be done by a sysop, or on console.

 Use 3S0ave Changes, and answer yes to make the changes permanent.  If you
answer no to abort and leave with no changes made.

 "3.AK0"  -- Aide Kill-Room

 This command will delete the current room.  After the command is done,
you will be placed in the Lobby.

 "3.AH0"  -- Aide Hallway

 This command will add or remove a room from the current hallway.

 "3.AW0"  -- Aide Window

 This room will make the current room a potential entry point into the
current hallway.  For example:  The room Zoot> is in hallways "Fred" and "Jim".
There is no window for Zoot> in either "Fred" or "Jim" so the < and > commands
will not move between hallways. If an aide person uses the W command while in
Zoot in hallway "Fred" the hallway "Fred" will be accessible from Zoot>.
This means that a user in hallway "Jim" could goto Zoot>, and then use
the < or > commands to get to Fred.

 2--- Groups ---0

 Users can be placed in multiple groups.

 "3.AG0"  -- Aide Group

 This command will add or remove users from a group.

 "3.AL0"  -- Aide List-Group

 This command will list all of the groups.  If an optional group-name is
appended to the end, it will list all users, rooms, and hallways in that
group.

 2--- Files ---0
 Directory rooms can contain files.  Three aide commands help maintain
files in directory rooms.

 "3.AA0"  -- Aide Attributes

 Attributes will change the read-only and hidden attribute of a file.

 "3.AU0"  -- Aide Unlink

 Unlink deletes a file from the directory room.  No wildcards are allowed.

 "3.AR0"  -- Aide Rename

 Renames a file.  Once again, no wildcards.

 "3.AM0"  -- Aide Move file
 Moves a file from one room to any path.

 "3.AF0"  -- Aide File set

 Searches through a directory and finds all files that have no FileInfo.Cit
entry and prompts the aide to supply one.

 "3.AS0"  -- Aide Set file info

 Allows an aide to edit the FileInfo.Cit entry for a particular file.

 2-- Miscellaneous --0

 "3.AC0"  -- Aide Chat

 Rings the Chat beeps even if the SysOp has turned chat off.

 The "3.RU0" read user log command lists extended status information about
each user, including Aide status, Unlisted entry, Permanent entry, Sysop
account, Network access, Problem user, No Mail, and accounting balance (if
accounting is enabled).
