 2--- General ---0

 Surnames are a brief decsriptory field placed before a user's name.  Some
BBS's do not use surnames.  Some allow only the SysOps to change them, and
other boards allow any user to change thier own surname.  The surname is
not part of the user name, but simply a displayed field.

 .ES  -- Enter Surname

 This command will allow you to enter a surname on some FredCits.  Oor
it may tell you "-- Users cannot enter thier own surnames".  To get a
surname there, you must ask the SysOp for one.  Some systems have no
surnames at all.
