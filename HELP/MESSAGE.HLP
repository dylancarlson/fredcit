 2HELP MESSAGE0

 2--- General ---0

While messages are being dispayed for you,  you can stop output by pressing
"S", pause it by pressing "P" (any key to continue), skip to the next
message by typing "N", skip to the next paragraph by pressing "J", toggle
ANSI on and off by pressing "~", and reverse the message direction by typing
"R".  The "P>ause J>ump N>ext S>top" header is a reminder that those work.
The "P", "N", "J", "S", and "~" keys work any time FredCit is sending you
information.

 2--- Reading Messages ---0

 E    -- Read all exclusive messages.
 F    -- Read all messages in forward order.
 L    -- Read all limited access messages.
 N    -- Read new messages.
 O    -- Read old messages.
 P    -- Read all public messages.
 R    -- Read all messages in reverse order.

 These commands read messages in the current room.  The commands 'F', 'N',
'R' and 'O' can by typed at the room prompt. They can also be combined
using .R options, for example:  ".RNR" (Read New Reverse) reads new messages
in a reverse order.

 2--- Entering Messages ---0

 E    -- Enter message.
 .ELM -- Enter Limited Access Message.
 .EE  -- Enter Exclusive message.
 .EO  -- Enter Old message.

 The Enter Message command is used to create messages.
 The Enter Limited Access Message command also creates a message, but limits
it to a particular group (you are prompted for a groupname, partial names are
acceptable, and you must be a member of the group to create a message in it).
 The Enter Exclusive message creates a private message.  Private messages can
only be seen by the sender and recipient.
 Enter Old message will recover any message you aborted, if you aborted the
message the last time you entered a message during the current session.

 Message entry is very simple.  You just type text (no limit on line length,
maximum message size is usually no less that 2000 characters, and can be
configured to be four times that, ask your local sysop).  To end your
message, press the carriage return key twice.  This will place you in
message edit mode.  There are several commands.  The most important are:
Replace String, Find & Replace, Save Buffer, Abort Message, and Continue.
These do the obvious things.  A "?" will get you a full list of commands.

 2--- Formatting ---0

 Messages are formatted to the callers screen width.  As much text as possible
will be collected on one line to send to the caller.  To defeat this, start
a line with a space.  This is also useful for delineating paragraphs in
your text.  Whenever you start a line with a space, that line will always
start a new line, no matter where in the previous line the system is.
Experiment in message entry using the Print command to see how this works.
