                   THE FREDCIT HOW-TO BOOK
                              
Welcome  to FredCit! Written and maintained by local Seattle
Citadel  guru,  Fred  McLain (with  many  helping  hands!*),
FredCit  is  one of several versions of the popular  Citadel
BBS   software  that  originated  many  years  ago  at   the
University of Washington as a simple game program.

Citadel  software is structured with "rooms" that reside  in
"halls".  The  interesting (and sometimes  tricky)  part  of
Citadel  is to locate the halls, which branch and twist  and
turn  in  all  sorts of interesting ways, depending  on  how
devious the Citadel Sysop might be. Once in a hall, you  can
quickly  see what rooms are available with a single command.
On  the other hand, the adventure of finding new halls  (and
finding your way home again) can become frustrating  to  the
newcomer or the uninitiated. In hopes of easing the  initial
frustration, I have prepared this book to help you  navigate
and  map your favorite FredCit board so you can get the most
use and enjoyment out of this delightful system.

"V"  as  the  2nd  letter  of the command.  "V"  stands  for
"Verbose"   and   will  sometimes  expand  the   information
displayed  to  you. For example, .RD (Read  Directory)  will
print  file  sizes  and download time as well  as  names  if
entered as .RVD.

.RA  (Reserved for future use) currently, same as ".R?"

.R?  Displays all .R commands

Upload / Download Commands
----------------- --------

FredCit  allows the Sysop to use any external  protocols  he
chooses,  so there are no standard upload/download protocols
on a FredCit board. On the other hand, most Cits in the area
use  the DSZ protocol program from Omen Technologies because
it  processes many of the most common protocols in a  single
program,  including the powerful ZMODEM streaming  protocol.

                      CITADEL COMMANDS
                              
Upload / Download Commands (Continued)
----------------- -------- -----------

Regardless  of the protocols available, you can  always  get
your  Sysop's  list  by  using the  "U?"  (Upload)  or  "D?"
(Download)  command.  These commands  will  not  initiate  a
transfer, but simply list the .U or .D commands necessary to
start  a transfer with the protocol lists available to  you.
The following commands are applicable IF your board is using
the Omen DSZ protocol program.

U  List the .U upload protocol commands
D  List the .D download protocol commands

.DC / .UC  Download / Upload using CRC Xmodem
.DX / .UX  Download / Upload using common (relaxed) XMODEM
.DY / .UY  Download / Upload using YMODEM-Batch protocol
.DZ / .UZ  Download / Upload using ZMODEM protocol
.D1  /  .U1   Download  /  Upload using  1K-XMODEM  protocol
(sometimes
           called YMODEM)
.D? / .U?  Same as D or U - list protocol selections

Please  note  that YMODEM-Batch and ZMODEM allow  global  or
multiple  transfers and wild-cards in the  file  names.  The
other  protocols  transfer a single  file  only.  (See  FILE
TRANSFERS later in this manual).  You can specify more  then
one  file name using wildcards characters such as *  and  ?.
.DZ  *.ZIP  would download all the .ZIP files in a directory
room.

Termination Commands
----------- --------

.T   Terminate (same as "T")
.TS  Terminate  and Stay - logs off your session  but  holds
     the line and re-prompts the logon cycle.

Message Editor Commands
------- ------ --------

When  your message is complete (or if you want to  get  into
print  and revise mode), simply hit 2 carriage returns.  The
message  editor  then  prompts for a command.  Valid  editor
commands are:

A   Abort  this  message.  (Will not  be  saved,  terminates
editor).
C  Continue with interrupted message entry.
F  Find and replace text. You will be prompted for string to
   replace.
P  Print  formatted.  Displays your  message  as  you  would
   normally see it while reading a room.
R  Replace text. Abbreviated version of "F"ind and replace.
S  Save the message and terminate the editor.
W  Displays total word count for your message.
?       Lists      editor     commands      (This      list)

                       NEW USER SETUP
                              
A  Citadel  Sysop has many choices about how to  handle  new
users.   These  choices  vary  all  the  way  from  allowing
immediate  open  access to requiring full validation  before
allowing a new user onto the board. Most public BBS'es  will
require  at  least some initial validation  before  allowing
full  participation, so you may have to  wait  for  a  brief
period   after   your  original  contact  before   you   can
participate.

This  section  details how to get (or request) your  initial
account,  and  some  options you might expect  in  different
environments.

1. Initial Logon
----------------

Citadel  prompts for initials, and a password. If the  board
does  not know who you are, it will ask if you want so  sign
on as "New". Answer "Y" to this prompt.

You   will  then  be  prompted  for  some  brief  additional
information:

a. The "handle" you want to use
b. Your name
c. A request to verify your password by retyping it

When  these  steps  are complete, you  will  be  asked  some
technical questions about your terminal equipment.

2. Terminal Configuration
-------------------------

The  initial  terminal  configuration  display  appears   as
follows:

------------------------
Screen Width.......  80
Height of Screen...  21
Uppercase Only.....  Off
Linefeeds..........  On
Tabs...............  Off
Nulls..............  Off
Terminal Emulation.  Off
IBM Graphics.......  Off
Helpful Hints......  On
lIst in userlog....  On
Last Old on New....  On
Room descriptions..  On
Auto-next hall.....  Off

Q to save and quit.

Change:

                       NEW USER SETUP
                              
2. Terminal Configuration (Continued)
-------------------------------------

If you have ANSI capability, one letter on each line will be
highlighted.  Use  that letter as a command  to  change  the
lines you need to change.

W   changes the width of your screen. Most IBM terms use 80-
    column line widths, but if you are using a Commodore  or
    other  40-column terminal, you will wish to change  this
    value  to  40 (or whatever your screen width  is).  This
    parameter  is  used  to determine word-wrapping  on  the
    message  editor  and message display for your  terminal.
    Other users will see your messages word-wrapped to their
    OWN terminal width-value.

S   changes  the number of lines your screen can display  at
    one  time.  This  feature is used to determine  when  to
    pause  during  message display. If you do not  wish  the
    screen  to pause at all, enter "0" for this value.  This
    is  NOT  recommended for speeds faster than  1200  baud,
    unless  you are a fabulous speed-reader. "21" is a  good
    value,  since  it  leaves room for the  "pause"  prompt.
    Also,  please note that for some reason, this  value  is
    sometimes not "held" at initial configuration.  You  may
    want  to  do  a .EC and re-enter this parameter  if  the
    screen is not pausing as you expected.

U   If you change this flag to "on", you will read and write
    in uppercase only. This is not recommended since most of
    the  BBS  community  interprets  uppercase  posting   as
    "shouting".  If  you have carpal tunnel  or  some  other
    physical  problem  that  makes  use  of  the  shift  key
    difficult  or impossible for you, use it and most  folks
    will  understand.  You may also be  using  an  old-style
    terminal that does not have a lower-case alpha set.

L   Sets  linefeeds  off  or on. If "on",  Citadel  supplies
    linefeeds.  If  "off"  your  terminal  must  supply  the
    linefeeds.

T   Sets tabs off and on. Recommended position is "off".  An
    exception is if the Citadel board you are on has  a  lot
    of  textfiles with embedded tabs. You may wish to tinker
    with this setting if you expect this to be the case.

N   Sets "nulls" off and on. This setting determines whether
    null characters (Hex 00) will be displayed - "off" means
    they  are  skipped and "on" means they will be shown  to
    you as a "space". See comment for "T"abs, above.




                       NEW USER SETUP
                              
2. Terminal Configuration (Continued)
-------------------------------------

E   Sets  terminal emulation to "off" or "ANSI BBS". If  you
    are  not  using  an ANSII terminal emulator,  turn  this
    "off".  "ANSII-BBS"  may be used successfully  for  some
    other kinds of emulation, such as VT-100, but colors and
    highlighting may not be as expected or intended.

G   Sets  IBM  Graphics  to  "Off" or  "On".  If  your  term
    supports an IBM graphics standard such as CGA, EGA,  VGA
    or Hercules, turn this switch "on" to display full color
    ANSII  graphics blurbs and messages. (Note:  FredCit  is
    not by design a graphics board, and graphics support  is
    fairly  limited. You will not lose much by leaving  this
    flag "off", or if you do not have IBM Graphics support).
    Turning  this  off  causes IBM  Graphics  characters  in
    messages to be translated to plain text.

H   Turns  "Helpful Hints" off or on. You may wish to  leave
    this switch "on" until the full use and scope of the BBS
    is  familiar to you. (See also the "Xpert mode" command,
    later in this book).

I   Turns  your "list in userlog" off or on. This determines
    whether  other  users  will see your  name  at  a  "View
    Userlog" prompt. Aides and Sysops will always be able to
    see your userlog entry, however.

O   Turns  the "Last Old on New" prompt off and on. If "on",
    the  last "old" message will be displayed along with any
    new messages in a room at the "N" (display new messages)
    prompt.   This  is  very  helpful  in  picking   up   on
    conversational  threads, and its use is recommended.  If
    "off",  only the newest message (since you were last  in
    that room) will be displayed.

R   Turns the room description line off and on. "On" is  the
    recommended  position.  On  some  FredCit  boards,  room
    descriptions are files with graphic characters. If  your
    term  cannot display these, turn off IBM Graphics  using
    the G setting.

A   Turns  on  the "Auto Next Hall" feature.  When on,  this
    feature  automaticly sends you to the  next  hall  every
    time you enter a room that can take you to another hall.
    Be  warned, some sysops set up their boards so that Auto
    Next  Hall  will get you lost.  Sometimes it's  best  to
    look where you're going.

Q   Quits  the  configurator and saves  your  new  settings.
    Remember, you can call up this display and change and of
    these  parameters with the .EC command. You may wish  to
    do  this  more than once if you change term programs  or
    one of the features is entered incorrectly.

                       NEW USER SETUP
                              
3. Alternate Sign-Up Scenarios
------------------------------

When you have completed your terminal configuration, several
different things may happen, depending on how the Sysop  has
configured the board to handle new users. The most likely of
these options are:

a) It  is  possible that you may be placed into a "new user"
   questionnaire.  If you are interested in  the  board  and
   wish to be validated, answer the questions truthfully and
   completely.

b) You  may  be  immediately allowed on the  board  to  read
   messages. You may not, however, be able to enter messages
   or to enter E-Mail until you have been fully validated.

c) It  is possible that you may be prohibited from any board
   activity  until you are validated. In this scenario,  you
   will  receive a note that you must be validated  and  the
   board  will  terminate your call. Most Sysops are  fairly
   conscientious  about validation, and you should  have  at
   least partial validation within 24 hours.

4. Group Membership
-------------------

One of the interesting features of FredCit is the user-group
function.  FredCit  allows (as of this  writing)  up  to  64
special-interest  groups to be defined to  the  system,  and
rooms  and entire halls can be restricted to certain groups.
As  your  participation on the board continues, you  may  be
invited  to join these groups by the Sysop or by Aides.  You
may  also wish to ask the Sysop what special-interest groups
are  available and indicate which you are interested in when
you  receive a response. Some group memberships may  require
that  you  be personally known to one of the board  managers
(such  as  an Adults Only or Guys Only/Gals Only group),  or
that you provide additional documentation about your age or,
perhaps, professional qualifications.

Group membership adds to the fun. You will find that you can
join  in  additional discussions with your group members  in
group-only  rooms  or down group-only halls,  and  with  the
Enter  Group Message command (.EG), you can read  and  write
messages  anywhere on the board which can be  seen  only  by
other members of your group.






                       NEW USER SETUP
                              
5. Customizing Your Account
---------------------------

If  the  Sysop has enabled Surnames, you may add, change  or
delete  both a Title and a Surname to your nym with the  .ES
command. The Title appears before your nym, and the  surname
after your nym on message headers. With a little creativity,
these  can  be  cute, bizarre or totally annoying,  such  as
[God, Here Comes] Your Nym [Wasted AGAIN!].

You  can (and should) change your password from time to time
with the .EP (Enter Password) command.

If  there are rooms that you never read, you may save a  lot
of time by simply excluding them from your normal navigation
path. This is done by entering an "X" (for Exclude Room)  at
the  room name prompt. If you want to add the room later on,
you can ".G"oto that room, hit "X" again and include it back
in your normal list. If you have forgotten the name, you can
find excluded rooms at any time with the .KX (Known Excluded
Rooms) command.






























                      BOARD NAVIGATION
                              
Citadel uses a hall-room construction, which is familiar (at
least      in     concept!)     to     users     of      the
IronHenge/StoneHenge/Minibin  board   programs   and   their
derivatives. While Citadel at first glance appears to  be  a
"tree"  with rooms branching off halls, and halls  branching
off  other halls, it is in fact "non-linear" - more  like  a
maze.

As  complex  as  it may seem at first, there are  some  very
simple tricks which you can use to navigate around a FredCit
board with complete confidence. All you have to remember  is
that  a  "hall" is simply a collection of rooms, and that  a
special  kind of room, called a "window" room is  the  place
where you enter and exit halls.
Keeping this in mind, a hall may have several "window rooms"
that  exit  to  other halls and part of the fun  of  Citadel
boards  is browsing your way up and down these halls as  you
find  them.  You can find the window rooms in  any  hall  by
typing in the "Known Windows" command (.KW or .KVW),  or  by
navigating  to  them with a "G" command.  (The  "G"  command
normally "G"oes to the next room with new messages,  but  on
FredCit, it will always "G"o to the next public window  room
in  the hall when there are no rooms left on the hall to  be
read.)

Once  you are in a "window" room, you may enter one or  more
halls  which window from that room. To find out which  halls
are  available  at  that window, use  the  "Known  Hallways"
command  (.KH or .KVH) to get a list of available halls.  It
IS possible that there are none, or that you can't "see" any
because  they are hidden or restricted to group-only  users.
You may move into one of the halls (or through the halls) by
using  the "Next Hall" command ( > ) or the "Previous  Hall"
command  ( < ). If there are no halls, or you are restricted
from  access  to  the halls by group-membership,  the  carat
commands  will show an empty hall name (Entering Next  Hall:
[blank]). Otherwise you will be "in" the new hall, but  also
"in"  the  same  window room you used  to  enter  the  hall.
Normally, when you first enter a hall, you will be  shown  a
list  of  rooms  with  read  and unread  messages.  You  may
generate  the  room list at any time with the "Known  Rooms"
command(s) (K, .KR or .KVR).

1. Location At Sign On
----------------------

When you first sign on to the board, you are located in  the
"Root" window room of the "Root" Hallway. Remember the  name
of  the  sign-on room! Most Citadel Sysops use this room  to
branch  to ALL the major halls of the board. Think  of  this
room as the "ground floor", or the "hub of the wheel".

1. Location At Sign On (Continued)
----------------------------------

If  any "New" messages exist in the "Root" window room, they
will be automatically displayed when you first sign on.  You
may,  of  course, enter a message of your own if you choose.
If  you  wish to browse new messages in the "Root"  hallway,
you  may use the "G"o command to go to each new-message room
and  the  "N"ew message command to read them. Remember,  the
"G"o  command will also pause at other window rooms (if they
exist), whether there are new messages there or not.

2. Navigating to Rooms Within a Hall
------------------------------------

Inside  of  any hall, the most common means of getting  from
room  to room is the use of the "G" command. The "G" command
is  limited, however to landing on unexcluded rooms with new
messages,  or  the next "window" room (see below).  You  can
single-step  from  room to room by  using  the  "="  (or  +)
command  (forward) or "-" command (backward),  or  go  to  a
specific  room  with  the .G [room name]  command.  You  can
immediately get the "lay of the land" with the  use  of  the
"Known"  commands (.K). The ".KVR" command is very  helpful,
since it will list all the rooms on the hall with their room
descriptions.

It  is possible that some rooms which you are authorized  to
visit may not be on the list shown by .KR or .KVR. These are
rooms you have excluded with the X or .EX command, or hidden
rooms, or limited access rooms. These kinds of rooms (except
hidden rooms) can be discovered with other variations of the
.K command (see CITADEL COMMANDS). You will have to know the
name  of a hidden room you are authorized to visit,  and  go
there with a .G [room name] command.

3. Navigating to Hallways
-------------------------

FredCit uses a special kind of room, called a "Window  Room"
to  exit to other hallways. The root room you first enter at
sign  on  is almost ALWAYS a window room, and may branch  to
several  additional halls. You can find this out immediately
by using the .KH command (known hallways). Whenever you find
yourself  in  a window room, .KH will list the  hallways  it
branches  to.  Find  all the window rooms  in  your  current
hallway  by using the .KW (Known windows) command.  You  may
then  ".G"oto  that window room, do a .KH and see  where  IT
goes.  You can see how Byzantine FredCit can get, and it  is
limited  only to a maximum number of rooms and  the  Sysop's
imagination!

3. Navigating to Hallways (Continued)
-------------------------------------

Once  in a window room, you may branch to the next hall with
the  use  of  the  ">"  (next hall) or "<"  (previous  hall)
command.  There IS one caveat! Sometimes, a window room  may
be public, but the hallway itself is limited access. In this
case,  you  will  see  the  prompt "Entering  Next  Hallway:
[blank]". The Sysop is probably doing this in order  to  let
users know the hallway is there, but is expecting you to ask
for access. Normally, you will see the prompt "Entering Next
Hallway:  [Hallway Name]". You may then browse  through  the
rooms in that hall, as noted in (2) above.

4. Special Kinds of Rooms
-------------------------

The standard room on a Fredcit Board is in reality simply  a
named collection of messages. You can enter messages in  ANY
room (except a Read-Only room) no matter what attributes  it
has. There are, however, several special types of rooms that
do  different things. Any FredCit room can have none, one or
all of the following attributes:

Anonymous Room: Anonymous rooms are rooms where the messages
   do  NOT  have  user-name headers. If you  enter  or  read
   messages  in Anonymous rooms, you will have to guess  who
   entered them.

Directory  Room:  Directory  Rooms  contain  collections  of
   external files. They may be text files, program files, or
   any  file  that can reside on a computer disk.  Directory
   Rooms  are the only kind of room where you can .ET (Enter
   textfiles),  .RT  (Read Textfiles),  Upload  or  Download
   files, or .RD (Read Directories).

External  Application  Room: These rooms shell  to  external
   programs  such  as  on-line games, questionnaires,  other
   BBS'es  or  perhaps a Usenet Node program - whatever  the
   Sysop  wants  to  do.  These  rooms  can  be  set  up  to
   automatically  shell into another program when  they  are
   entered, or more commonly, to require the user to enter a
   .EA  (Enter application) command to execute the alternate
   program.

Group  Access Room: Group rooms are configured so that  they
   may be entered only by members of a specific Group. Those
   that  do not have group membership will not be aware that
   the  room  exists.  Hallways can also have  a  Group-Only
   attribute.

4. Special Kinds of Rooms (Continued)
-------------------------------------

Hidden Room: Hidden rooms never appear on any K or .K lists,
   and  must  be entered with a .G"oto" [room name] command.
   These  rooms  are  used for private  or  very  restricted
   conversations.

Network  Rooms:  If your Sysop is using the FredCit  Network
   feature,  Network rooms will contain messages from  other
   boards, and you may send and receive messages and  E-Mail
   to  users on other boards in your network in these rooms.
   See  CITADEL NETWORKS later in this book.  These are also
   called "Shared" rooms.

Read-Only Room: This type of room is restricted from message
   or  file  entry. It is most commonly used for collections
   of  system messages such as additional help files,  board
   policy statements and files, system announcements and  so
   on.

Window  Room:  Window  rooms are portals  to  hallways  (see
   Navigation paragraphs above).






























                  USING THE MESSAGE EDITOR
                              
The  FredCit message editor is a basic, yet fairly  flexible
line-editor with automatic word-wrap and easy to use  string
replace commands. The editor automatically formats itself to
the  width  of  the  user's  (and  the  reader's)  terminal,
although the formatting CAN be defeated (as outlined below).

The  editor may be invoked at any room prompt (except  in  a
Read-Only  Room) by simply entering the "E"  command.  There
are   some  other  alternatives  which  invoke  the  editor,
depending  on  what type of message you are entering.  These
are:

E   Enter a public message in the current room message base.
.EE Enter  Exclusive  message (E-Mail) in the  current  room
    message base.
.EG Enter a "group only" message in the current room message
base.
.EL Enter a "limited access" message
.EM Enter a message (same as "E")
.EO Enter an "old" message (does not update new pointers)
.ET Enter a textfile into a directory room file-set.

When  the message editor is invoked, you will be shown  some
information,  chief among which is the maximum message  size
allowed by the FredCit you are on. The most common value for
maximum  message size is 8192 characters, although depending
on your Sysop's choice at configuration, the maximum message
length  can be any value up to 16,384 characters. After  the
initialization  process is complete, you  may  begin  typing
merrily away until you have got it all off your chest.

When  you are finished with your message (or if you wish  to
suspend  entry  and do some proofreading or editing)  simply
type  two  carriage  returns. This places  the  editor  into
command  mode, and you will get a "Command:" prompt  at  the
bottom  of  your  screen.  If you are  unsure  of  what  the
commands  are,  type a "?" to get a list. (All  the  message
editor  commands are listed in CITADEL COMMANDS  earlier  in
this book.)

These  commands  are pretty self-explanatory.  However,  new
users sometimes are not aware that the "F" command (Find and
replace text) displays the requested text IN CONTEXT with  a
few  words  before  and  after the  requested  string.  When
entering the replacement text, remember to replace only your
"search  string"  (highlighted on your screen).  Also,  when
saving  your message: if you have used .ET (enter textfile),
the editor will ask you for a description of the file before
completing the save.





                  USING THE MESSAGE EDITOR
                              
Defeating Auto-Format
--------- -----------

If you wish to defeat the automatic line-width formatting of
the message editor because you are using indents or tabs  or
some  other highly formatted message structure, simply begin
each  line  with  a  "space". The word-wrap  will  still  be
active,  but  you  may  "force" the  formatting  by  hitting
carriage  return  at the end of your line (before  the  word
wraps  to the next line) and starting each new line  with  a
"space".

Uploading a Prepared Message
--------- - -------- -------

To  upload a previously prepared message, invoke the message
editor  as  normal.  When you would normally  start  typing,
simply  begin an ASCII upload (Do NOT use an error  checking
protocol!)  of the file which contains your message.  Unless
your terminal is unusually fast, you shouldn't have to tweak
your  ASCII  transfer  pacing. The message  buffer  responds
extremely rapidly.

When your transfer is complete, simply press carriage return
once  or twice to save or edit your message exactly  as  you
would if you had typed it.

One  note:  if  you wish to defeat message formatting,  your
ASCII text file must begin each line with a "space" and have
embedded carriage returns at the end of each line. The  line
length  should not exceed your configured screen  width,  or
the  line  will  be  wrapped by the editor  software.   Some
terminal  programs have an 'expand blank lines' feature  for
text uploads.  Turn this feature on if you have it.

1. Locating Files
-----------------

The  only  places  where external files  are  located  on  a
FredCit  board are the Directory Rooms. You can  locate  the
directory  rooms along any hall you may be in by  using  the
command  .KD  (Known Directory Rooms). Once in  a  Directory
Room,  you  may list the files available for Downloading  by
using  the .RD or .RVD command. The .RVD command also  shows
the  size  of the file and the approximate time to download.
Unless  the Directory Room has a Upload-Only attribute,  you
may also Upload files into these rooms.

2. File Types and Naming Conventions
------------------------------------

A  Directory Room may contain any type of file which can  be
stored  on  an IBM disk. You should exercise caution  before
attempting to use a program file uploaded from ANY  BBS  ...
if you don't have a good, current virus scanner, GET one!

Since  FredCit  runs  on  IBM  computers,  files  stored  in
Directory  Rooms use the standard IBM naming  convention  of
"filename", followed by an optional ".[ext]" where [ext]  is
a  1-3  character  extension name. It  is  a  fairly  common
practice  for  text files to NOT use an extension,  or  they
will be extended with a .TXT, or .ASC (for ASCII) or .DOC  -
these  are the most common. Files which have been compressed
with one of the major archivers will have an extension which
names  the archive program used (.ZIP .PAK .ARC .LZH,  etc.)
and  you will have to have the proper software to expand  or
decompress  them after download. An executable  IBM  program
will  have the extension .EXE or .COM. There are many  other
standard  conventions for graphics files (.GIF, .TFF,  .WPG)
and  so on. If you are unsure about what a file is, leave  a
query  in  the  message  base in  the  Directory  Room,  and
hopefully the contributor or someone else who has  used  the
file will fill you in.

On FredCits, as on other BBSes that allow downloads, program
and data files which originate from other computers can also
be  stored.  It  is  hoped (but not  guaranteed)  that  file
formats  incompatible with your equipment will be identified
with  an  extension convention. On extensive libraries,  you
may  find MacIntosh and Apple programs, Commodore and  Amiga
software, UNIX modules and a variety of different things  to
use, depending on your equipment. On the other hand, it  can
be  quite  disconcerting to .RT (Read textfile)  a  textfile
that has been stored in petascii or EBCDIC encoding!




                       FILE TRANSFERS
                              
3. Reading Textfiles
--------------------

After  you  have used .RD or .RVD to locate a  textfile  you
wish  to  browse,  you may read the file  directly  on  your
screen and optionally save it in your capture buffer or with
an  ASCII  download if your terminal allows this, by  typing
.RT (Read textfile) and giving the filename when prompted to
do so. The file will be sent directly to your screen.

4. Loading Textfiles
--------------------

You  may enter a textfile into a Directory room with the .ET
command. This command invokes the message editor, but  saves
the message to a file rather than the message base. For more
information,  please  review the USING  THE  MESSAGE  EDITOR
section of this manual.

5. Downloading Files
--------------------

You  may  download any Directory Room file directly to  your
machine  by  invoking the .D command for  your  protocol  of
choice.  Remember that your term program  has  to  have  the
selected protocol available at your end. Please refer to the
Upload  /  Download section of CITADEL COMMANDS for  a  more
complete  discussion of invoking Download routines.  If  you
are  using a batch (multiple file) protocol such as  YMODEM-
Batch  or  ZMODEM, you may specify more than one file  at  a
time, or get multiple files by using IBM wildcards.

If  you  are unfamiliar with DOS wildcard conventions,  they
are  quite  simple.  An  asterisk (*) replaces  clusters  of
characters (meaning any characters) and a question mark  (?)
replaces a single character. Thus:

abc*    will  find any UNEXTENDED file that starts with  the
   characters "abc"
abc*.*  will  find  any  file  of any  extension  (including
   unextended files) that begin with the characters "abc"
*abc.*  will  find any file of any extension that ENDS  with
   the characters "abc"
*.*    will find EVERY file
*.ZIP  will find any file with the extension "ZIP"

abcd?.zip  will find all files that begin with "abcd",  have
   some   unspecified  5th  character,  and  have   a   .ZIP
   extension.

Is this clear? I THOUGHT so!

6. Uploading Files
------------------

If  the  Directory Room you are in is not a Read-Only  room,
you may upload files into the Directory by invoking whatever
.U  protocol you have available to you. Please refer to  the
Upload  /  Download section of CITADEL COMMANDS for  a  more
complete discussion of invoking Upload routines.

If  you  wish to remain friends with the Sysop and the  user
base, please remember these rules of Upload Etiquette:

1. If  the Sysop has designated or requested that you Upload
   into  a  specific room, please honor that  request.  Most
   Sysops   like   to  have  a  chance  to  review   uploads
   (particularly executable uploads) for viruses, copyrights
   and  duplications.  If  you are unsure  what  your  board
   policy is, ASK first!

2. Never  knowingly upload a virus or trojan horse  program,
   or  a  program  that is not designated Public  Domain  or
   shareware.  The BBS community is so paranoid about  these
   problems that your first upload of this type is likely to
   be  your  last,  on  this board or  any  other.  The  BBS
   community is pretty small in this area!

3. If you Upload a textfile that is somebody else's work not
   in  the  public  domain,  do it with  permission  of  the
   author!  Please  honor  copyrights and  the  intellectual
   property of others. Unauthorized or plagiarized work  can
   get   everyone  in  trouble,  aside  from  the  essential
   dishonesty involved.




















                      CITADEL NETWORKS
                              
FredCit has some extensive networking capabilities to  other
FredCit  boards,  and  other  compatible  Citadels.  Network
arrangements  are made among other Citadel  Sysops,  and  if
your   favorite   FredCit  board(s)   participate   in   the
networking, the end result to you will be one or more  rooms
on  your board which will contain messages from other boards
and  their  users,  and  your  messages  in  the  designated
networked rooms will in turn be sent to the other  BBSes  on
the network.

For  the  most part, the process is transparent to you.  The
only  difference is that message headers in Networked  rooms
will show the name of the board of origin, and depending  on
the  frequency of the network connection, message and  topic
threads  can get pretty disjointed. You have to  be  patient
when  responding to remote board users, and in  waiting  for
replies!

Your  public  messages in Networked rooms will be  sent  out
automatically.  If  you want to send E-Mail  to  a  user  on
another  board, you must address the user with the following
convention:

   [Username]  @ [Nodename] Where [Username] is the  nym  of
   the  E-Mail recipient and [Nodename] is the name  of  the
   user's  home board. As an example, if you want to  E-Mail
   Metal  Maniac at Ninja House of Horrors, you must address
   your  .EE  message  to "Metal Maniac  @  Ninja  House  of
   Horrors".
   
Of  course,  your local FredCit can't check the validity  of
the  name,  so  if  you misspell it, your  friend  will  not
receive the message.
If  Metal  Maniac  gets your message and is  a  believer  in
answering  mail, your response will appear in the Root  Hall
Mail Room.

The  good  part is that the board will automatically  insert
the  correct return address when you auto-reply to networked
E-Mail.  If  you answer "Y" to "Reply? (Y/N)", FredCit  will
address Metal Maniac's return mail FOR you.

Networking is an option. If you are a Citadel fan and  would
like  to  participate in networking, pester  your  Sysop  to
check  it  out. He may dun you for his phone bill if  things
get out of hand, however!
