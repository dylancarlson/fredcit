          This is a synopsis of FredCit networked messages, and to attempt
          to explain FredCit networked message structure.  It's my hope
          that this document will aide others in creating network gateways.

                    Enjoy!

          Message Records


          Messages are transmitted as a series of files.  The files contain
          message records, with no header or terminating part to the
          message file.  The hex value FF is used to mark the beginning of
          each of these records.

          Message record structure:


               <0xff><mbattr><mbId><section ...><'M'><message text><0>


          Message Attributes


          mbAttr is an 16 bit binary number defining the message
          attributes.  It's format is:

          Bit       Token     Purpose

          0         MAIL      Private message.
          1         RECEIVED  Received mail.

          5         LIMITED   Limited-access message.
          6         MODERATED Moderated message.
          7         RELEASED  Released by moderator.
          8         COPY      Message a copy.
          9         NET       Networked mail en-route.
          10-15     Unused    Future expansion.

          Bits 10-16 are undefined, and may assume any value.  Some of
          these values may not be used in netting.


          Message sections


          Message sections start with an ASCII letter, and are terminated
          by a null.  No binary values are used.

          C, F, and L type records do not net out.


          Message text


          Message text may be of any length, but on networked systems is
          normally 8k.  Messages longer then this will be truncated.




          _________________________________________________________________

          1. NAMESIZE is 30 characters.

          2. ASCIIZ is ASCII with a terminating null character.

          3. For copies.

          4. For group only messages.

          5. For file linked messages.
